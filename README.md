# AO-Roads-Mapping-Bot

## Project Objectives
The following project aims to create a roads mapping bot for the game Albion Online that fulfills the following criteria:
- Allows users to add / delete / show links between the zones in the Roads of Avalon
- Allows user to retrieve information of a given zone such as tier, resources and other features
- Zones that are expired are to be removed from the database automatically

## Additional Features
In order to make it easier for users to use the bot, the bot has been deployed on Discord! Furthermore, short-form names of zones are allowed to be used in order to reduce the amount of work that users have to put in when adding / deleting or showing links for zones!
